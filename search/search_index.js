Nothing in the known Standard Model (SM) of elementary particles accounts for such elusive matter. So what is it made of? And how does it interact with the world we can see (which is the SM)?</p> <p>My research aims to solve this enigma by exploring how dark matter (DM) and other exotic particles from a hidden sector behave in some of the universe's most extreme environments. I study how dark-sector particles (let me call them $X$) interact with the blazing-hot, super-dense matter and radiation found in stars, neutron stars, and the early universe. These cosmic crucibles act as natural laboratories, amplifying subtle interactions and providing us with powerful clues. Inverting the perspective, I also investigate how a background of dark matter could subtly alter the behavior of ordinary matter. By looking for these faint imprints it is possible to open new windows into the dark sector. By developing new theoretical tools and applying them to real-world observations and experiments, my work bridges the gap between theory and observation, bringing us closer to uncovering the secrets of our hidden universe.</p>"},{"location":"research/index.html#recent-highlights","title":"Recent Highlights","text":""},{"location":"research/index.html#resonant-x-leftrightarrow-sm-conversions-in-astrophysics","title":"Resonant $X \\leftrightarrow SM$ Conversions in Astrophysics","text":"<p>Certain hidden $X$ particles, such as axions and dark photons, can interconvert with photons when traveling through astrophysical media.

As hidden particles traverse regions with varying density, temperature or magnetic fields, they may encounter multiple resonances.

Interiors of magnetic white dwarfs can house immensely strong magnetic fields, exceeding $10^9$ Gauss (over billion times stronger than Earth!). In such strongly magnetized plasma, hidden-particle emission becomes strongly directional and resonant conversion can occur even in regions where it would be kinematically forbidden in an isotropic plasma. For axions, this magnetically induced resonant emission far exceeds the standard Primakoff or bremsstrahlung channels.

Most existing studies approximate these production rates using simplified Boltzmann equation calculations, which can be off by large factors compared to full thermal field theory results based on the imaginary part of the self energy. My approach provides a systematic diagrammatic mapping of multi-loop self-energies onto thermally weighted tree-level rates, revealing new interference effects that had been missed before.

Normally, the slightly heavier excited state must be depleted before recombination to satisfy CMB bounds. But in the resonant regime \u2014 when the dark-photon mediator mass is just above twice the dark-matter mass \u2014 this is not required. The resonance reduces the annihilation coupling at freeze-out, allowing a non-negligible excited-state population at recombination without violating CMB bounds. Because the excited state can survive to late times in this regime, the model predicts observable signatures that are usually suppressed in standard inelastic scenarios: late-time annihilation (indirect searches), exothermic scattering or upscattering (direct detection), and modified self-interaction phenomenology.
