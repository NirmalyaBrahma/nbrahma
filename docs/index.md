<p>
I am a theoretical physicist working at the intersection of astrophysics, cosmology and particle physics, 
with a focus on uncovering the particle nature of dark matter. I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in physics 
at McGill University, where I work under the supervision of 
<a href="https://katelinschutz.com" target="_blank">Katelin Schutz</a> as a 
<a href="https://frq.gouv.qc.ca/en/program/frqnt-2024-2025-doctoral-training-scholarships/" target="_blank">FRQNT scholar</a>.

Before joining McGill, I earned my B.S. and M.S. in physics at the <a href="https://iisc.ac.in" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Science</a> (IISc) in Bangalore. Beyond research, I enjoy mentoring younger students and to engage in science communication, with a focus on making physics accessible and inclusive.

My first name is pronounced as "NIR-mal-LO" and my last name as "bruh-ma".
