I am a theoretical physicist working at the intersection of astrophysics, cosmology and particle physics, with a focus on uncovering the particle nature of dark matter. I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in physics at McGill University, where I work under the supervision of <a href="https://katelinschutz.com" target="_blank">Katelin Schutz</a> as a <a href="https://frq.gouv.qc.ca/en/program/frqnt-2024-2025-doctoral-training-scholarships/" target="_blank">FRQNT scholar</a>.

Before joining McGill, I earned my B.S. and M.S. in physics at the <a href="https://iisc.ac.in" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Science</a> (IISc) in Bangalore. Beyond research, I am dedicated to supporting the next generation of physicists, particularly those from diverse backgrounds and experiences, and I actively engage in science communication and mentoring.

My first name is pronounced as "NIR-mal-LO" and my last name as "bruh-ma".

If you would like to learn more about me, you can find an introduction to [my research](./research/index.md).
