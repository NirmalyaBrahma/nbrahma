I am a theoretical physicist working at the intersection of astrophysics, cosmology, and particle physics, with a focus on uncovering the particle nature of dark matter. My research explores how dark matter interacts with the visible universe by connecting fundamental particle theory with astrophysical and laboratory data to reveal the hidden ingredients of our cosmos.

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in physics at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/" target="_blank">McGill University</a>, Canada, where I work under the supervision of <a href="https://katelinschutz.com" target="_blank">Katelin Schutz</a> as a <a href="https://frq.gouv.qc.ca/en/program/frqnt-2024-2025-doctoral-training-scholarships/" target="_blank">FRQNT scholar</a>.
Before joining McGill, I earned my B.S. and M.S. in Physics at the <a href="https://iisc.ac.in" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Science</a> (IISc), Bangalore, India (for more detail look at my <a href="./media/CV_Nirmalya.pdf">CV</a>). Beyond research, I enjoy mentoring students and engaging in science communication, with a focus on making physics accessible to wider audiences.
